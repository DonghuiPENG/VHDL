\hyperlink{class_flip__flop___r___w}{Flip\+\_\+flop\+\_\+\+R\+\_\+W} \+: This entity with synchronization reset is uesd to perform a special port. It could be read by microcontroller and writen by I2C. That means if I2C set \textquotesingle{}i2c\+\_\+write\textquotesingle{} on one, it would put the data of \textquotesingle{}i2c\+\_\+data\+\_\+in\textquotesingle{} into the output \textquotesingle{}uc\+\_\+read\textquotesingle{}. It could be one or zero.\+It just likes its write fonction. Then we can use its output as the input of microcontroller. It likes read by microcontroller.
