Condition\+\_\+detect \+: This entity with synchronization reset is used to separate the S\+C\+L\+\_\+tick in differents states according to S\+C\+L\+\_\+in.

In fact, there are 10 S\+C\+L\+\_\+tick periods in one S\+C\+L\+\_\+in period. We are defining certains S\+C\+L\+\_\+tick period as certains points of S\+C\+L\+\_\+in period. It\textquotesingle{}s just like naming those S\+C\+L\+\_\+ticks to be used in the future. On S\+C\+L\+\_\+in low level, there are two sequence points like falling and write. On S\+C\+L\+\_\+in high level, there are four sequence points like rising,stop,sample and start. All of these points would hold on its value on one S\+C\+L\+\_\+tick period. If there are more than 5 S\+C\+L\+\_\+tick periods in half S\+C\+L\+\_\+in period, it will stay on the waiting state to wait for the S\+C\+L\+\_\+in level changes. If there are less than 5 S\+C\+L\+\_\+tick periods in half S\+C\+L\+\_\+in period, it will transfer to error state. First, it need to judge the S\+C\+L\+\_\+in level to start its special points. Then, it would transfer its state one by one in each S\+C\+L\+\_\+tick period. It always works until the S\+C\+L\+\_\+in signal disappear. Or it transfer to init state when synchronization reset equals to \textquotesingle{}0\textquotesingle{}.
