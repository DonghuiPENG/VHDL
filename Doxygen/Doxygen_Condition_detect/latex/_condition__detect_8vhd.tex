\hyperlink{class_condition__detect}{Condition\+\_\+detect} \+: This entity with synchronization reset is used to detect the condition of action from master by line S\+CL and S\+DA. According to the protocol of I2C, we need to use these two lines inputs. First, we need to judge the S\+DA data on every S\+CL high level. There are also three outputs to indicate these conditions. Stop condition means S\+DA from zero to one, start condition means S\+DA from one to zero. Start condition could be acted after the stop condition on the same S\+CL high level, that means restart condition. It\textquotesingle{}s same as a stop with a start. But, it can\textquotesingle{}t act the stop condition after the start condition , that makes no sense. And the state will transfer to init state. If it\textquotesingle{}s on S\+CL low level, it would also transfer to init state and waiting for the next judgement.
